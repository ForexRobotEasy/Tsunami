## Global Variables

- `D1` (integer): Alteration threshold for average price
- `T1` (integer): Time threshold for average price alteration
- `orderSize` (double): Predefined order size
- `stopLossMultiplier` (double): Multiplier for StopLoss value
- `ticket` (integer): Order ticket number

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. It sets the flag for dynamic StopLoss activation based on the initial order type. If the initial order is a sell order, the StopLoss is set to 0 initially.

## Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It calculates the average price using the `CalculateAveragePrice()` function and checks for notable price movements using the `CheckPriceMovement()` function.

If a notable price movement is detected, the function executes the first order in the direction of the price movement. If the average price is greater than the previous close price, a buy order is executed. If the average price is less than the previous close price, a sell order is executed.

If a sell order is executed and the StopLoss is not activated, the function activates the StopLoss by modifying the order with a stopLossValue calculated using the `stopLossMultiplier` and `T1` variables.

## Calculate Average Price

The `CalculateAveragePrice()` function calculates the average price by summing up the closing prices of the previous `T1` bars and dividing the sum by `T1`.

## Check for Notable Price Movement

The `CheckPriceMovement()` function checks if the difference between the current price and the average price is greater than the `D1` threshold. If the difference is greater, it returns true indicating a notable price movement, otherwise, it returns false.
